### Introduction

This repository compares different methods of obtaining interpretabel dimension in word embedding spaces. 

More specifically it compares: 
* [Densifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07572.pdf)
* DensRay: A method closely related to Densifier, but computable in closed form. 
* Support Vector Machines / Regression
* Linear / Logistic Regression.

The evaluation tasks are lexicon induction and set-based word analogy. 

For more details see the [Paper]().

Note that this repo does not include an implementation of the Densifier, but relies on the original Matlab implementation by the authors of Densifier.


### Usage

For an example how to use the code see `example.sh`.
